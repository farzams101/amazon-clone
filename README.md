## Acknowledgements

I created the project with the help of Clever Programmer's YouTube [video](https://youtu.be/RDV3Z1KCBvo)
and taking help from [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) whenever I got stuck.

I made the following improvements to the application along the way:
- Improved the UI
- Fixed bugs with payment
- Replaced deprecated libraries with newer ones
- Added missing data validation

Note: I've not deployed Cloud Functions as it requires payment. So, the payment feature will not work in the deployed app.
